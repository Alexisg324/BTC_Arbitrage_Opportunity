## Crypto Arbitrage
This project analyzes two datasets from two csv files (bitstamp.csv and coinbase.csv).  The period of time the data is analyzed is from the months of Jan to March.  The sum of the project will seek artbitrage (purchasing an asset together in different markets in order to make profit).  

## Technologies Required
Python 3.10
Pandas
Pathlib
matplotlib
Jupyter lab

## Installation Guide
Installing Python (MacOS):

Command + Space
Enter Terminal in search bar and press enter
Terminal should open
Open Homebrew Installation website in browser (https://brew.sh/)
Copy installation code at the bottom of the page Copy shown link into terminal
Once Homebrew is installed, install Python
Open Terminal
Enter "brew install python3" into the CLI to install Python
Installing Anaconda with Python (MacOS):

Return and type Y when prompted
Open environment by entering "conda activate dev"
Enable terminal commands through conda 

Clone local Repo: 
git clone https://github.com/Alexisg324/BTC_Arbitrage_Opportunity.git

Install Software:
pip install pandas
pip install pathlib
pip install jupyter lab

## Usage 

As a user, I want to recieve an analysis on which cryptocurrencies would be best to invest through arbitrage.  

In order for the user to use the app, there must be 2 or more csv files included in the Resource folder.  In this case, the folder contains bitstamp.csv and coinbase.csv.  The app should be able to create analysis for the user with graphs/plots that calculate profit.  

Below is an example of what that analysis looks like for the user:

## License
license() A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Release Derived Year Owner GPL- from compatible? (1)

0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes 1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes 1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no 2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no 1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI yes (2) 2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no 2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes 2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes 2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause. According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.
